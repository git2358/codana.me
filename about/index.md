**Hi** :-)

My name is **Michael Chadwick**, and I'm both a `software developer` and audio guy. I like to tinker with [code]({{ site.gh_link }}), and I also like to make patterned, and sometimes unpatterned, [air movements]({{ site.bc_link }}).

Occasionally, these interests intersect and I make stuff that [incorporate]({{ site.gh_link }}/utter) [both]({{ site.gh_link }}/my-mac-amp).
